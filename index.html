<!-- the doctype. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (about 1991/2), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to follow to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful things. However, these days no-one really cares about them, and they are really just a historical artifact that needs to be included for everything to work right. For now, that's all you need to know. -->
